# Little Dig Game

This is a little game about working for a company that consumes planets to extract value.

You're in charge of sending workers to the planet to wander around and collect resources.

You can play this game in your browser at [bicken-bones.com](https://bicken-bones.com/) or on Itch.io at [bicken-bones.itch.io/little-dig-game](https://bicken-bones.itch.io/little-dig-game).

Beware of interlopers.

## Additional Info

This game is written in pure JS, with the core gameplay rendered in a canvas element.

I created this just as a fun little side project, with inspiration drawn from (much better) games such as [Digseum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3361470/Digseum/) and [(the) Gnorp Apologue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1473350/the_Gnorp_Apologue/).

The code is unpolished and in someplaces downright ugly, but that's the beauty of solo side projects. I took a "just get it to work" approach with a lot of the functionality in this game.

And finally, all credit for the Latin used in the research titles goes to the fine folks over at [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). This is also my way of apologizing for the (probably) butchered Latin. Mea culpa.

Thanks to the devs and artists for those free resources!
